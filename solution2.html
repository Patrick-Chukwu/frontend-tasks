        Scotland is home to the tallest waterfall in Great Britain, named Eas a’
        Chual Aluinn. At 658 feet, it is three times the height of Niagara
        Falls, just not as famous.

        Scotland is home to the oldest tree in Europe and it is one of the old
        living organisms in the world. It is a twisted yew that has been around
        for over 3,000 years. It’s easy to see why this is such a mysterious
        country!

        The raincoat was invented in Scotland by a man named Charles Macintosh,
        hence the name the “mac”. We’re not saying it rains a lot, but having a
        good mac does help.

        The small Scots town of Bonnybridge has become the UFO capital of the
        world. The town has more than 300 sightings of Unidentified Flying
        Objects reported every year.

        Scotland is home to the world’s shortest commercial flight in the world.
        The journey from Westray to Papa Westray in Orkney is approximately 1.5
        miles long and takes just 47 seconds. The tickets are quite expensive
        too!

        You have to be very thankful to Scots, because they helped invent the
        modern world. Scotsman Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in
        February 1876, and engineer John Logie Baird created the world’s first
        TV picture on October 2, 1925.

        One of the more interesting facts about Scotland, but since the 1970s
        all imports of haggis to the US have been completely banned. If you want
        to good stuff, get yourself to Scotland.

        some people think that the world-famous chicken tikka masala was
        invented by a Pakistani chef in Glasgow in 1971. Even though Scotland
        might be better known for haggis, battered Mars bars and whisky,

        Even though Scotland has a population of 5.3 million people, there are
        more people with Scottish heritage living in the US than there are in
        Scotland. The number of Americans of Scottish descent today is estimated
        to be 20 to 25 million.

        Scotland has the highest proportion of redheads in the world. A whooping
        13% of the population are redhead. Sir Chris Hoy and Euan McGregor are
        two fine examples of Scottish redheads. If you like redheads, you know
        where to go.
