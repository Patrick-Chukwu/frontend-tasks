    <p>
      Scotland is home to the tallest waterfall in Britain, named Eas a’ Chual
      Aluinn. It is 658 feet, which is 3 times the height of Niagara Falls. The
      official animal of Scotland is the Unicorn. Scotland has approximately 790
      islands. Scotland is home to the oldest tree in Europe. It is a twisted

      <li>  Scotland is home to the tallest waterfall in Great Britain, named Eas a’
            Chual Aluinn. At 658 feet, it is three times the height of Niagara
            Falls, just not as famous.</li>

            <li>   Scotland is home to the oldest tree in Europe and it is one of the old
                living organisms in the world. It is a twisted yew that has been around
                for over 3,000 years. It’s easy to see why this is such a mysterious country</li>

                  The raincoat was invented in Scotland by a man named Charles Macintosh,
                    hence the name the “mac”. We’re not saying it rains a lot, but having a
                    good mac does help.</li>
                    <li>  The small Scots town of Bonnybridge has become the UFO capital of the
                        world. The town has more than 300 sightings of Unidentified Flying
                        Objects reported every year.

                    <li>    Scotland is home to the world’s shortest commercial flight in the world.
                        The journey from Westray to Papa Westray in Orkney is approximately 1.5
                        miles long and takes just 47 seconds. The tickets are quite expensive
                        too!</li>
                        <li> You have to be very thankful to Scots, because they helped invent the
                            modern world. Scotsman Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in
                            February 1876, and engineer John Logie Baird created the world’s first
                            TV picture on October 2, 1925.</li>

                            <li>   One of the more interesting facts about Scotland, but since the 1970s
                                all imports of haggis to the US have been completely banned. If you want
                                to good stuff, get yourself to Scotland.</li>
                                <li>
                                    some people think that the world-famous chicken tikka masala was
                                    invented by a Pakistani chef in Glasgow in 1971. Even though Scotland
                                    might be better known for haggis, battered Mars bars and whisky,</li>
                                    <li>   Even though Scotland has a population of 5.3 million people, there are
                                        more people with Scottish heritage living in the US than there are in
                                        Scotland. The number of Americans of Scottish descent today is estimated
                                        to be 20 to 25 million.</li>
<li>  Scotland has the highest proportion of redheads in the world. A whooping
    13% of the population are redhead. Sir Chris Hoy and Euan McGregor are
    two fine examples of Scottish redheads. If you like redheads, you know
    where to go.</li>
